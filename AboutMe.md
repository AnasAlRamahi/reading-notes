## **Anas Al-Ramahi**

  Hello there, my name is Anas Al-Ramahi, and I am a fresh Computer Science Bachelor's Graduate from the Hashemite University. And I'm learning web development, and I have the ambition to be a proffesional in this field.
I am ambitious, work under pressure, fast learner and I learn mostly by myself.
If didnt read about the blog I concluded in the main page about the Growth Mindset already, I highly recommend you to do so. I included the link to it in the bottom of this page.

  In order to focus more and get myself motivated I like to do these activities:
- Light workout in the morning.
- Drink some coffee in the morning, and alot of water during the day.
- And I try my best to make my working place as comfortable as possible, and get red of distracting stuff, my phone for example.
